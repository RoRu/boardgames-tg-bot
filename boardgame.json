Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \"Encounter\" cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.   Scythe  uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.  Every part of  Scythe  has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times. ",

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station.

Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy. \r\n  Pandemic Legacy  is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic   Pandemic  , in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions. \r\n After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to. \r\n Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards. \r\n During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play. ",

(This action replaces Double Action Build in original  Brass .) \r\n The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. \r\n  Birmingham  features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. \r\n Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original  Brass  as well as in  Brass: Birmingham . \r\n  New \"Sell\" system  \r\n Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also \"grease the wheels of industry\" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. \r\n  Birmingham  features three all-new industry types: \r\n  Brewery  - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. \r\n  Manufactured goods  - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. \r\n  Pottery  - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. \r\n  Increased Coal and Iron Market size  - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. ",

If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too. \r\n To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea. \r\n Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements. \r\n And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. \r\n We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents. \r\n Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points.

Each round consists of one or more of five possible phases. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phasea€s action, while the selecting player(s) also get a bonus for that phase. For example, if at least one player chooses the Develop action, then the Develop phase will occur, otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from his hand of cards to build. After revealing the cards, each player adds his development to his tableau of cards on the table and then discards cards from his hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose Develop discards one card fewer as his bonus. Explore allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to his hand. Settle allows a player to place a world in his tableau. Some worlds produce goods, represented by face down cards, when Produce is selected.

Players are given a sandbox in which to play as gods, moving their workers around the board to build up a beautiful, multi-tiered city. Do you have what it takes to outsmart your opponents? Find out, in  Santorini ! \r\n \r\n \r\n   Santorini   is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been continually developed, enhanced and refined by designer Gordon Hamilton. \r\n Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps: \r\n  1. Move  - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels. \r\n  2. Build  - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play. \r\n  Winning the game  - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win. \r\n  Variable player powers  - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played. \r\n \r\n \r\n   Turns in  Santorini  are made up of two simple step: Move and Build. Move around the board and build a building in a spot adjacent to one of your workers. The first player to move their worker from a second level building to a third level building wins the game! Though, there are a few things that add a wrinkle to the basic formula.  Invoke the Power of the gods! Each player will have access to a god power which lets them do things a little differently than normal. Be it changing the rules for how you can build or move, changing how you interact with other players, or providing you with an alternate victory condition, the 30 different god powers are sure to make every game of  Santorini  different and exciting! \r\n ",

Can you make it to the end of your journey and turn a tidy profit? Find out in Great Western Trail!   Simple Mechanics, Complex Decisions  Turns in Great Western Trail are broken into three simple phases that will carry you through the entire game. These simple phases belie a web of deep and complex decisions players will face as they make their way down the trail. The mechanics are simple, but mastering the trail is where the fun lies.   Make Your Move!  A turn starts by moving your cattleman down the trail. The number of spaces a player is allowed to move is dictated by their player board, and there are hazards a plenty all along the trail. Wherever you end up, the next phase is ...   Take Action!  When a player ends their movement, they perform the action listed on the space they ended on. Depending on where you land, you will have different options available to you. Neutral locations or buildings you own will allow you to perform a special action specific to that location or a single auxiliary action. On locations owned by other players, hazard tiles, or teepee tiles, your only option is to use an auxiliary action. Last, there's Kansas City!   Kansas City or Bust!  Landing on Kansas City sets off a series of subphases that must be resolved in order: Three Foresight phases, the Income Phase, and the Delivery Phase. The Foresight subphases give players a choice between two tiles to add to the board (hazard, teepee, or worker). These tiles will affect future trips down the trail, so choose wisely. Earn income from your journey down the trail by revealing and discarding your hand. Finally, choose a city to deliver your cattle to. This leg of your journey is over. Now it's time to do it all again!   Draw!  Draw up to your hand limit and your turn is over! Time to start planning your next move and figure out the choices you'll face in the coming turns. \r\n ",

It's the Vikings' last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin's side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \"Gods' Gifts\" grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death! ",

    "description_preview": " Prospector, captain, mayor, trader, settler, craftsman, or builder? Which roles will you play in the new world? Will you own the most prosperous plantations? Will you build the most valuable buildings? You have but one goal: achieve the greatest prosperity and highest respect! This is shown by the player who earns the most victory points. He will win the game! \r\n \r\n \r\n In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings. \r\n Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons. \r\n The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists. \r\n During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \"Trader\" or \"Builder\"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \"Builder\" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game. \r\n Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. \r\n Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game. \r\n In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I – New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II – The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n 0 Links \r\n \r\n ",

The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark preexisting routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power plants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you?re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all.   Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants (except for the highly valuable renewable energy wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes. \r\n  Power Grid: Recharged Edition  will replace Power Grid. Small but meaningful improvements have been made to the game including updated rules to improve game play, an updated player order tracker, new reference cards, and a discount token to enhance power plant auctions.

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. \r\n Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete and does not require the original version. More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponents route to connect yours.   The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces. The overall goal remains the same, collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins. \r\n -International Gamers Award 2005 ",

As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks.

This means players are working together toward one common victory condition--but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective.

Good organization is key: wheelbarrows have to be filled with goods at the warehouses and then swiftly transported by the assistants to the various destinations. The goal of the merchants is to be the first to collect a certain amount of rubies.  You are leading a merchant and four assistants through the 16 Places of the bazaar. At each Place, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge is that, to carry out an action at any of those Places, your merchant needs the help of an assistant and has to leave him behind. To use that assistant again later, your merchant has to come back to that Place and pick him up. So plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything... ",

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats? \r\n Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over. Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it's important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do. ",

    "description_preview": " \r\n Centuries ago, the spice trade was the most important market in the world. It established and destroyed empires, compelled men to explore the far corners of the earth, and led to the discovery of new worlds. At that time, the value of spices even rivaled that of gold! In the old days, they carried a sense of mystery and allure. Spice merchants would weave fantastic tales of danger to reach these spices in hopes of selling their wares at higher prices. In later centuries, the demand on spices became so great, that those who controlled the spices generated immense wealth and renown. It is at this time, you find yourself leading your caravan across the eastern lands to the Mediterranean Sea in search of wealth and fortune. As a caravan leader, your journey begins on the Spice Road. This is Century: Spice Road!  In  Century: Spice Road , players aim to collect and trade spices in order to acquire point cards and coins that are worth points at the end of the game. Players play cards from their hands to acquire spices for their caravan and trade those spices in for wealth and power (point cards and money), or to purchase new merchant cards to more efficiently acquire rare and valuable spices. Players take one action a turn until someone has acquired their fifth (or sixth in 2-3 player game) point card, players will finish out the current round of play and the person with the most points wins!   Play or Acquire Cards  At the start of the game, each player is given two merchant cards to start with and some preliminary spices. On their turn, each player may choose, as their action for the turn, to play a card from their hand, or spend spices to acquire a new merchant card from the row and place it in their hand. Merchant cards allow players to acquire new spices, exchange spices they currently have for different ones, or upgrade a spice to one worth more. Building up a good spice trading engine of merchant cards is an important part of succeeding on the Spice Road, so look out for powerful play sequences when taking new cards!   Rest  Once they've played all the cards from their hands, players must use their turn action to rest and return their cards to their hand. Now they'll be able to play their cards again on future turns, building up their caravan and further developing their hand of merchant cards to start acquiring point cards.   Claim Point Cards  The way to win in Century: Spice Road is to have the most points at the end of the game. Players get points when they acquire Point Cards and Coins by trading in their spices. Each point card in the row will have a different cost and overall point value listed on it, and the spice cost must be paid to acquire that card. If the two leftmost cards in the row are acquired, whoever acquired one of those point cards can take a coin from the pile above it. Silver coins are worth 1 point at the end of the game and gold coins are worth 3 points! Once a player has bought their fifth point card, the round of play finishes and a winner is crowned! \r\n ",

In this tile-laying game 2 to 5 players are the chieftains of 5 famous clans. The players try to build their little kingdoms to score as many points as possible. But in each game only 4 of the 16 scoring cards will be scored. Each game is different and leads to different tactics and strategies.  To have enough money is useful in all games: In each turn the players can buy a tile from another player. The seller determines the price, but to do it wisely is the most interesting part of this game: A high price will lead to wealth, if someone buys this tile, but if there's no buyer, the seller will lose the money spend on this tile.  And in the end the player with the best kingdom will become the sovereign of the island, not the richest player!  Isle of Skye is a gateway game for the whole family. With a playing time around 45 minutes , a huge variability and easy rules it's a perfect game for all players. The awesome illustrations by Klemens Franz brings all the athmosphere of the scottish island on your table. ",

For years, Corp Inc. Has tottered on the brink of bankruptcy: transporting building materials to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is greatest, is a risky business.  The company was saved by a few visionaries on the board of directors. Instead of shipping materials to the Periphery, they reasoned, why not build the materials into spacecraft and let them ship themselves? Furthermore, why hire pilots if there are nut-cases who will do it for free?  That's where you come in. Just sign the contract, and you gain unrestricted access to a Corp Inc. Warehouse. Build your own space ship from the available prefabricated components, and fly it to the Periphery. Of course, you may have to eat a loss, but any profits you make along the way are yours to keep, and Corporation Incorporated will pay you a bonus for quick delivery.  It's possible that you will end up with an insurmountable debt and finish your days panhandling on the streets of Deneb III, but if Lady Luck should smile upon you, you just might find yourself among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy!

Together with his father, Marco hoped to establish news trade routes to bring riches from the East back to Europe, and in  The Voyages of Marco Polo , you will attempt to do the same. \r\n Players will attempt to recreate Marco Polo's famous journey over the Silk Road, playing as Marco and his father or one of their many associates from their travels, each with their own unique power. Collect points by completing contracts, visiting new cities, and reaching your final destination of Beijing and the court of Kublai Khan. Do you have what it takes to prosper? Find out in  The Voyages of Marco Polo !   Preparing to Set Out   The Voyages of Marco Polo  is a Dice Placement game. At the beginning of each Round, players will roll their dice and then take turns placing those dice in space on the board for various effects. Some spaces have the same effect no matter the number on the die placed there, but some spaces have different effects depending on their result of the roll. Some spaces even require you commit multiple dice and take the action based on the lowest number rolled among the dice placed there. \r\n Placing dice is how players move their merchants down the trade routes and toward Beijing, gather money to pay for goods and their travels, acquire resources to fulfill their contracts. And, spaces are limited! Once another player has filled a space, you'll need to spend more resources in order to take the same action, potentially setting your plan back or forcing you to readjust. Plan well and choose your actions wisely, and you may just find yourself ahead of the pack.   Multiple Strategies  There are many decisions to be made from round to round, and there are multiple avenues to victory in any given game. The roads you take to victory can change from game to game thanks to the special power of your character and the unique city bonuses used for each.   Unique Powers   Each character has their own unique ability that can hugely impact your strategy as the game progresses. Raschid ad-Din allows you to choose the value of your dice rather than rolling them. Niccolo and Marco Polo give you an additional figure to move across the map and a camel at the beginning of every round. Take advantage of your special skills and leave your opponents in the dust!   Different City Cards Every Game!   With 31 different city cards, every voyage will be unique. Plan your route carefully as you seek to take advantage of the bonuses each city has to offer. At the beginning of each game, the city bonus cards will be drawn randomly from the deck, providing new strategic opportunities and incredible replayability. \r\n ",

Scarred by the flames of betrayal, Rex is a specter of a fallen empire and of ages long forgotten, yet it remains an object of reverence-and desire-in a galaxy of conflict and uncertainty.  Once, the great city that spanned its surface was the pinnacle of civilization. Today, Mecatol City is naught but a blasted shell of its former glory, a grim respite in the toxic Sea of Desolation that covers the majority of the planet.  Even so, its parabolic history of decadence and destruction does little to deter those who would seek to harness its power. The Winaaran custodians who dwell within the remnants of the city maintain what is left of the former capital, waiting for one of the Great Races to step forward and take up the mantle of the former Emperors.  But who among the races of the galaxy could fill the void left by the Lazax? To lay claim to the throne is a destiny sought by many, yet the shadows of the past serve as a grim warning to those who would follow in their footsteps...     \r\n   Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition   is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy. \r\n No two games of  Twilight Imperium  are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate. \r\n A round of  Twilight Imperium  begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways. \r\n After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points. ",

Of course, it's 2017 and guests are easily bored. So, you should probably build some roller coasters and shops to keep your guests entertained. Oh, and maybe invest in some security, because if you don't your dinosaurs may escape and eat your guests, and who wants to deal with regulators coming in and telling you your park is a \"death trap\".  The game uses 10 full-color dice to create the pool of available DNA at the beginning of the round, and features really unique artwork inspired by early 90s graphic design to catch your eye and 3d renderings for the rides. The game contains Dino-meeples, double thick cardboard with cut outs to keep tracking cubes from sliding when the table is bumped, and two unique mechanisms that we are really fond of.  The game-length is variable from 60 minutes to 2.5 hours regardless of player count simply by adjusting the number of \"end-game\" cards used. The game also features \"plot twist\" cards that change certain game rules each time you play for endless replay-ability. No two games will ever be the same!  The game is a mid-weight strategic worker-placement game with strong thematic integration with the mechanics. We've found the games complexity to be a bit lighter while maintaining tense decisions. This was accomplished by breaking various actions into 4 unique phases so that order of operation is less critical to your success allowing new players to grasp the flow of the game quicker. ",

Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival.

Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.   After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within.

The Swan allows you to lead the next trick even if you lose this one. The Fox lets you switch a card in your hand with the decree card setting the trump suit. The Woodcutter lets you swap a card in your hand with one of the extra cards. The Treasure will give the winner of a trick a free point for each 7 in the trick. The Witch will act as the trump suit if it's the only witch in the trick.

First, the player with the longest continuous path of trains receives a ten point bonus. Second, each player scores bonus points for connecting the cities on one or more tickets with two distinct routes.

Each knows 9 secret agents that the other must contact. Communicating in coded messages, they sneak past enemy assassins in an attempt to complete their mission before time runs out. \r\n  Codenames: Duet  is a cooperative word game for two or more players. A key card gives you 9 words to give clues and 3 words your partner must avoid. A clue is only one word, but it can point to multiple words that you want your partner to guess. Your partner also gives you clues for the words you need to find. If you both find all the words before you run out of turns, you both win! \r\n With a new way to play, 400 new words that work with the original  Codenames , and 100 new challenges,  Codenames: Duet  is sure to push your mind to the limit!   Go Undercover!  In  Codenames: Duet , players must work together to uncover all the secret agents on both sides of the key card before they run out of turns. You'll need to be quick-witted, because these challenges will put your deductive skills to the test!    It Takes Two to Tango!   You and a partner will pick a key card and set up the grid of words. You'll take turns, going back and forth, giving each other clues to guess as many words as possible before passing to the other player. On their turn, a player gives a word and a number as their clue and the other player makes guesses as to which words hide a hidden operative. Correct guesses are covered in a green agent card, if a player guesses a word that is black on your key card, the game is over and you lose. If a guessed word is tan on the key card, that is an innocent bystander and the turn ends with you taking a token from the time bank and placing it on the guessed word. If the two players can guess all 15 hidden operatives before running out of turn tokens, they win the game!   Sudden Death   If players run out of time, they enter sudden death, relying on previous clues to guess where the remaining operative are hiding. If a word is guessed correctly, the guessing continues, but if a bystander or assassin is uncovered, the game is over and the players lose.   More Ways to Play!   Codenames: Duet  is designed for two players, but it can be played with a group. Players will split up into two teams and play the game as normal, any member of a team able to give the clue. Teams may privately discuss their clues to come up with the perfect one! \r\n Players may also embark on a campaign using the Mission Map pad. Each completed game will let you move on to new and more challenging missions that change the number of turn counters and bystander tokens. Some missions reduce the number of turns you have while other leave less room for error. After completing these challenging missions, you can consider yourselves Codewords masters! \r\n ",

Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. Secret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre. The first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor's word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team. The second new mechanic is the \"Hitler\" identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players' trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game. ",

The War of the Ring is a grand strategy board game that allows its players to immerse themselves in the world of J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and experience its epic action, dramatic conflict, and memorable characters.  As the Free Peoples player you command the proud hosts of the most important kingdoms of the Third Age. From the horse-lords of Rohan to the soldiers of Gondor and the Elven lords of Rivendell, you lead the defense of the last free realms of Middle-earth.  Face the evil minions of Sauron on the field of battle in a desperate attempt to delay their onslaught, while you lead the Fellowship of the Ring in the Quest for Mount Doom.  As the Shadow player you lead the hordes of the Dark Lord and his most powerful minions as they try to bring darkness to Middle-earth. Legions of Orcs, Trolls, Wolfriders, and the dreadful Ringwraiths await your command. Hunt the Ring-bearer and bring the precious Ring to his Master, or crush your enemies with your unstoppable armies.  This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age! \r\n \r\n \r\n In   War of the Ring  , one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not. \r\n The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest. \r\n Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track). \r\n Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle. \r\n \r\n ",

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top? \r\n In   Colt Express  , you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases: \r\n \r\n  Phase 1: Schemin'  Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck. \r\n  Phase 2: Stealin'  The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights! \r\n \r\n The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play. \r\n Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items — but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car. \r\n Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground. \r\n You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too. \r\n At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins! \r\n \r\n \r\n   Nominated for the 2015 Spiel des Jahres award.

Nevertheless, Eclipse has a lot of details and theme woven seamlessly into the game. For example, you may design your own starships: each player has four ship types that they can build and design as they will. The technology tree also has a new, non-linear system.

Beginning a New Age  A game of  Ethnos  is divided into three Ages in which players will try to gain as much glory as possible. On their turn, players will choose to Recruit an Ally (from either the deck or the face up options on the table) or Play a Band of Allies. Recruiting allies to your cause is necessary if you want to gain any influence in the Six Kingdoms, which you do by playing Bands.   Band Together   When you play a Band of Allies from your hand (from 1 to 10 cards), each ally within the band must belong to the same Tribe or the same Kingdom (color). Each band has a leader which will determine the ability you get to resolve when playing the band. If the band is large enough, you may place one of your control markers in that kingdom that matches the color of your leader card. You then use your leader card's ability. Then you must discard the cards remaining in your hand face up for other players to recruit from. These bands will be important for scoring at the end of the round, so leave them in front of you.   Control the Kingdoms   As you gain more influence in a Kingdom, the bigger your bands must be to place your control markers there. Each Kingdom will reward players with an amount of glory at the end of an Age according to who has the most influence in each Kingdom. As Ages pass, the players with the second-most and third-most influence in each Kingdom will also gain glory.    A New Age Dawns   The game will play out over three Ages, and the heralding of a new Age is brought on by the arrival of three dragons. Once the third dragon has been drawn from the deck, the Age ends and scoring for that Age begins. Control markers persist between Ages, representing the influence gained in Ages past.

On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.

In Citadels Classic, the same inspired and simple gameplay remains, with players attempting to build a fantastical medieval city by constructing different districts. Each round, starting with whoever holds the crown, players will pass around a hand of characters equal to one plus the number of players, secretly choosing one character to employ, taking advantage of their special ability. Among the eight characters you might find, each boasts a different special ability: the Thief can steal all the gold from another player, the King grants gold for each Noble district you have constructed and receives the crown for the next round, and the Architect allows a player to build several districts that turn.   After all players have chosen their character, they are revealed in the order determined by their rank, which is the number printed in the upper lefthand corner of their card. For example, if a player chose the Assassin with its rank of 1, they would resolve their turn first. The next to follow is the Thief with its rank of 2, then the Magician at 3, and so on, skipping characters that were not employed this round, and until all players have resolved their actions.  When you do resolve your turn, you will choose to either take two gold coins from the bank or draw new district cards. Then, if you can afford to pay its cost, you may construct a single district from you hand. You may also resolve your character abilities as they apply during your turn, whether it be naming a character to kill with the Assassin or gaining extra gold with the Trader. Play continues until all players have resolved their actions, then the character cards are reshuffled and a new round begins.  The first player to construct seven districts triggers the endgame, allowing the round to finish and all other players to take their final actions. Each district is worth its cost in victory points, with bonus points awarded for those who construct all seven of their districts and those who have at least one type of each district (noble, religious, trade, military, and unique). Whoever has the most victory points has built the most fabulous city and is crowned winner! ",

After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner. \r\n In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply). \r\n A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round. \r\n The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region.

At the start of each round, players receive a secret card letting them know where they are - a casino, space station, pirate ship, circus, (30 unique locations!) - except that one player receives the SPY card instead of the location. The Spy doesn't know where he is, but wins the round if he can figure it out before he blows his cover!  Players then start asking each other questions during the intense 8-minute rounds. Non-Spy players want to ask questions and give answers that prove to the other players that they know where they are. But watch out! If your questions and answers are too specific, the Spy will easily guess the location and win, so you need to practice a bit of subtlety. But if your questions and answers are too generic, you might be accused of being the Spy. The Spy will also sometimes be asked questions (just like any other player would) and have to come up with questions of his own, without knowing anything about where he is! If you listened carefully to the other players, you'll be able to come up with a plausible question or answer... hopefully.  Once per round, each player may accuse another player of being the Spy. If all players agree, the game ends and that player's secret card is flipped up. If the Spy is captured, each of the Non-Spy players win the round. If a Non-Spy is revealed, the Spy wins. Finally, if the Spy figures out where he is, he can reveal his card and make a guess. If he's right, he wins the round. If not, the Non-Spy players win.  The game is played over a series of rounds and points are awarded each round. A complete game is typically five rounds and the cards are randomly dealt each round.

Nine different kinds of terrain are on the variable game board, including locations and castles. During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player's existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.   By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.  Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards (3 of 10), special actions (4 of 8), and terrain sectors to build the map (4 of 8), ensuring you won't play the same game twice! ",

On November 1, 1755, Lisboa suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, followed by a devastating tsunami and 3 days of raging fires. The city was almost totally destroyed.  Lisboa is thus played, in part, on a representational map of the city. During the planning of the downtown re-building project, the type of businesses permitted in each street was pre-determined. The clockmakers and goldsmiths had their street; as did the bookstores and libraries; the tailors and silk vendors; and the toolmakers as well. This all comes into play on the Lisboa gameboard.   Players represent the nobility of Lisboa who will use their influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city.   In rebuilding the city, players will make use of the Royal Builder, who works with the architects to build Lisboa anew, while the Marquis will provide aid in the development of commerce. The King will provide players with political help in re-opening the beautiful new city. But the true reason you are rebuilding the city is not for greatness, or even fame or fortune. As a nobleman or noblewoman of Lisboa, your primary motivation is the acquisition of Wigs--a most important trading commodity of the Era, and the means of scoring points in the game. ",

Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next. \r\n  The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game  is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players. \r\n Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire. \r\n The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign. ",

As a chief astronaut from a private space exploration company, you want to be a pioneer in developing the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars, achieving the OMDE mission goals as well as your company’s hidden agenda.

    "description_preview": " On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers - Meriwether Lewis and William Clark - to discover this huge terra incognita. Lewis & Clark is a board game in which the players manage an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.   Lewis & Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new \"hand building\" mechanism fits strongly the historical background. Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial. ",

This Reiner Knizia classic makes a great travel game and an easy one to introduce to friends and family.

Game Summary: Players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth, namely the ten luxury possession (positive-number) and three 2X multiplier cards; while avoiding its pitfalls represented by three cards altogether, including the gambling (-5) card; the thief (lose a possession) card; and the calamitous fire (lose one half the value of all your possession cards) card. While bidding, though, players must keep an eye on their remaining cash.

What a great idea! Yeah, and no one else is doing it! No competition! We'll be rich!\"  And now you have just opened the first pet shop in town. Right next door to the other first pet shop in town. Across the street from two more.  Buy baby monsters! Feed them and watch them grow! Clean their cages!  Yes, running a pet store is exciting for an imp. But it can also be mentally challenging: What is the smartest way to win the upcoming exhibition? Which pet is best suited for your dungeon lord customer? How strong a cage do you need, and if you guess wrong, how many family members will be maimed?  Win or lose, you are sure to enjoy the grand opening of Dungeon Petz. \r\n   \r\n \r\n \r\n Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business – breeding and selling petz. Sound simple and safe? Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them – but the profit is unbelievable. \r\n   Dungeon Petz   is a standalone game set in the  Dungeon Lords  universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime, they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points. \r\n \r\n ",

You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.  \r\n Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. \r\n Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities - and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. \r\n Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.  \r\n At the end of each turn, new \"infection dice\" are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!. ",

But, as we have already learned from history, a single man's will, if strong enough can change the world. It wasn't different with Magoria either; it only took one person, with immense talent and ambition, to change things forever.  A talented young boy inspired by the enigmatic world of illusion tried his luck on the street with his revolutionary acts of magic. It didn't take long for people to take notice, and within weeks, he was already considered to be a genius by the public. The acts of even the greatest illusionists of the time seemed shallow and mediocre compared to his talent. In less than a year, the youngster became one of the greatest magicians of his time, a true legend of illusion who became known as Dahlgaard the Magnificent.  Trickerion - Legends of Illusion is a competitive Euro-style strategy game set in a fictional city inspired by the late 19th century urban life and culture, where players take on the role of rival stage illusionists.  Players strive to become the city's greatest Magician by acquiring the most Fame points. But there is much more at stake than prestige alone. The audience's favourite wins the contest for the mighty Trickerion Stone, a relic that grants supernatural powers to its owner, making him a true Legend of Illusion. ",

During the course of the game, the players develop their farms and deliver goods to the village as they vie to earn the title of La Granja for their country estate. Speed and timing is critical!  La Granja is a fascinating game that requires careful planning. Successful players must learn to cope with the vagaries of the dice and cards. The player who has earned the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner and new owner of the La Granja estate!  Over the course of 6 game rounds, players will expand their farm by adding fields, farm extensions, market barrows, and helpers. They will earn VPs by delivering goods to the village of Esporles. Players have two options to early VPs in the village:  1. When a player has fully supplied a craft building, he received VPs and a craft market which grants a bonus for the remainder of the game.  2. When a player has fully supplied a market barrow on his farm, he sets up a market stall in the marketplace and receives VPs and a trade commodity.  It is important to observe the actions of other players, to manipulate turn order, and to adjust for the dice and the cards during the course of the game. ",

You'll go for the dice again and again only to risk losing it all on a single roll. Players try to win three of the eleven number columns as quickly as possible. To do this, they roll the four dice and form two pairs, which determine the columns on which they may first place the white cones (the runners). During their turn, players may roll the dice as long as they wish -provided that they can place or move at least one of the runners. If, after rolling the dice, a player is unable to do so, his turn ends immediately and he loses everything that he achieved during that turn. He should have stopped in time... but he didn't!

Each role has a main full action and a less valuable \"favor\" action. If you are the first player with that role you announce that you are that character.

Each quilt has a particular pattern that must be followed, and players are also trying to create color and pattern combinations that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also able to attract the cuddliest cats! \r\n Turns are simple. Select a single patch tile from your hand and sew it into your quilt, then draw another patch into your hand from the three available. If you are able to create a color group, you may sew a button onto your quilt. If you are able to create a pattern combination that is attractive to any of the cats, it will come over and curl up on your quilt! \r\n At the end of the game, you score points for buttons, cats, and how well you were able to complete your unique quilt pattern.

To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully. \r\n At the heart of  Legends of Andor  is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or \"Legend\", a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale. \r\n Will their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm? Uncover epic tales of glory as you live the Legends of Andor! ",

The Emperor has inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. Realising the depth of chaos his father’s long reign had caused, the Longqing Emperor set about reforming the government by re-employing talented officials previously banished by his father. The Emperor resides in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. The Forbidden City is currently known as “Gùgõng” (Imperial Palace) by the people of China. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified and expanded. During this period, China was under heavy attack the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty. \r\n The country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. However, the Longqing Emperor tried to eradicate corruption as much as he could, by simply having it officially prohibited, and punishable by death. \r\n This measure seemed successful at first, but as we all know, it is not so simple to keep perfect control over one’s “loyal” subjects. At the imperial court, the highest officials would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, and instead of simply accepting money, a new custom saw the light of day: the exchange of gifts. \r\n If a petitioner visited an official to present a request, they would also present a gift. And naturally, the official would return the honour by presenting a gift in return. If the gift of the petitioner was something quite valuable, like, say, a Jade statue, and the return gift from the official was a cheap paper fan, it was hard to regard this as an act of bribery. However, both knew very well how valuable the symbolism of said item could be… \r\n “Gùgõng” uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. The players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by bribing certain officials responsible for certain tasks, by offering suitable gifts. \r\n A player wins by gaining an audience with the emperor. If several players succeed to do this, the player with the most VPs amongst those players wins the game. ",

The foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis. The next level are species that feast on the sea's abundant plant life — zooplankton. All of this takes place in Catherine Hamilton's beautifully illustrated central board called the Reef. Every other oceanic species is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. And even bigger than apex predators are enormous filter feeders that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path with their baleen. \r\n  Gameplay  Oceans is a continuation of North Star's quest to make a gamers' game that is easy to teach. Game designers Nick Bentley and Dominic Crapuchettes don't think people need to sit through 30+ minutes of rules explanations to get an immersive experience. \r\n The foundation of Oceans is a simple turn structure and a deck of 10 straightforward traits, making it easy to learn all of the cards and wade effortlessly into the first game. The 10 traits were chosen because of the rich thematic interconnections, providing a tapestry of synergistic card play. Additionally, there are 4 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate (and sometimes deactivate) at various points during the game. The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game. \r\n This foundation loosely mimics a scientific oceanic ecosystem, similar to what you've come to expect from games in the Evolution series. This is the core of Oceans and it's fully playable on its own. But there's more if you are willing to dive a bit deeper... \r\n Oceans also includes something which will break the seams of the scientific reality you've come to accept: The Deep. The Deep is a deck of 100 unique power cards that require an additional cost to play. These power cards range from things you might find in nature to the fantastical Kraken or Leviathan. \r\n Oceans is an engine builder where the world of science is disrupted at the seams by the world of fantasy. Players must adapt to the changing environment with an interconnected ecosystem that can survive and thrive against the inevitable march of time and the natural struggle of predators seeking to survive.

Nasty goblins now pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving, and sacred, mushroom folk - and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...  In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure nostalgic of old Nintendo games like The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.   Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.  Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat, and by gryphon to get to all the places they need to go to satisfy their quests - or to position themselves for what night brings. Each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.  During the night, players must face the challenges of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.  The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner! ",

Ingenious is an abstract tile-placement game in which the players take turns placing tiles in the shape of two connected hexagons into a hexagonal grid on the board. Each tile has two colored symbols on it. Players earn points in a specific color for each line of matching colored symbols that they extend when they place a tile. A player's final score is determined by his or her lowest scoring color, not the highest. The winner is the player whose lowest score is the highest compared to the other players' lowest scores, and not the player with the highest scoring color overall. \r\n \r\nThe game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two hexagons connected along one side. Each hexagon has one of six colored symbols in it, with most tiles having two different colored symbols and some having two of the same colored symbol. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it. During his or her turn, each player places one tile from his or her rack onto two empty hexagonal spaces on the game board. For each of the two hexagons composing this tile, the player scores one point in the hexagon's color for each already-placed hexagon of the same color that radiates outward in a straight line from one of the placed hexagon's five sides. If a player's score in a color reaches 18, he or she immediately takes another turn. At the end of the turn, the player refills his or her rack to six tiles. \r\n \r\nWhen no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins. \r\n \r\nIngenious includes rules for solitaire and team play.

But you do have a rich uncle, recently departed, who decided on his death bed to leave all his money to the relative who will enjoy it the most. To find out who that is, you and your cousins will each be given a substantial sum of money. Whoever can spend it the fastest will inherit all your uncle's wealth.  Last Will is a race to bankruptcy. In each round, you choose a plan for the day, which determines how many options you will have available and how much time you will have for them. If you don't give yourself enough options, you might find yourself with nothing left to do after attending the theatre. If you don't set aside enough time, you might have to forgo dinner prepared by London's most famous chef or a carriage ride with a charming guest. And don't neglect your property investments. Or rather, do neglect them: Once your properties depreciate, you can sell them for a pittance, bringing you that much closer to bankruptcy. The upper class lifestyle provides you many opportunities to spend your uncle's money. Just be sure to spend it fast.  A luxurious life of fabulous wealth is within your grasp. With your uncle's Last Will, bankruptcy leads to riches! \r\n In   Last Will  , each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players. \r\n Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being: \r\n \r\n Take a card on display and add it to your hand. \r\n Draw a card from any regular deck – This can be chosen only once by each player. \r\n Visit the opera and spend $2. \r\n Adjust the value modifiers in the property market. \r\n Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards. \r\n \r\n Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses – of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! – to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy. \r\n At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market. \r\n If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins. ",

In Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. Stockpile centers around the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile. First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock's value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time. Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line. Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding?

Eight investigators have come together to track down Mr. Jack, still at large. Mr. Jack is very clever, though: he is pretending to be one of them ...  \r\n   Mr. Jack   is an asymetric game for two players. Each player has a different aim. One takes on the role of the Detective, the other Mr. Jack. The Detective must unmask Mr. Jack's cover and then catch him. Mr. Jack will try to use the cover of darkness to slip away while doing his best to slow down the investigation. Using successive deductions, by moving characters in and out of the darkness, the Detective will reduce the number of suspects and tighten the noose around Mr. Jack. Will he capture Mr. Jack before the end of the eighth turn? \r\n During each turn, the players move the characters, using their special powers and placing them either in shadow or light. At the end of each turn, the witnesses declare whether Jack is visible — that is, in light or adjacent to another character — or not (alone in the shadows). This allows the investigator to know which characters are innocent. As the turns progress, the investigator tries to eliminate suspects while Jack tries to escape. Intuition, logic, and cold blood will be necessary for each of the two participants. \r\n  Mr. Jack  is a tense game of light and darkness. A best seller, it can be played by all.

Jamey read over the rules and was impressed both by what the airships added to the game and by the effort Kai had put into the expansion through writing the rules and playtesting it. So Kai, Jakub, and Jamey collaborated to hone the airship module.

Each player's airship miniature (a new type of unit; 1 big miniature for each of the 7 factions [the sculpts are identical, and the bases are different colors to match the factions]) has those abilities, as well as the core ability that airships are free to move onto any territory (land or water) and across rivers. Each player starts with their airship on their home base, so they can start moving out of their home area right away. The airship miniatures measure 104x34x42mm, and they have clear, plastic, removable stands/bases.  In the resolution module, resolution tiles add a twist to the way each game ends. There are 8 of them, and 1 will be used each game. They often have an impact in the decisions you’ll make throughout the game. ",

Each player represents one of the international companies who are gathering machineries, innovative patents, and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to capture and exploit the water power of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers. \r\n  Barrage  includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms. First, the construction wheel has to be managed by players to carefully plan their actions and handle their machineries since both your action tokens and resources are stored on the wheel and come back only after a full wheel round is completed. The more you construct and perform maintenance on your wheel, the earlier that resources and actions return to you. \r\n Second, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches dams downstream), raise their dams to increase capacity, and build long tunnels to divert water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed — its flow is just used to produce energy — and released in the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover water diverted by you and other players. \r\n Over five rounds, players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to increase their machineries to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique effect buildings to customize their own developing strategy.

After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans — whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began. \r\n In   Azul: Summer Pavilion  , players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family. \r\n  Azul: Summer Pavilion  lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds. \r\n At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present. \r\n After all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile. \r\n If you complete surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile. \r\n After six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins. \r\n  —description from the publisher  ",

Soon after, the banks awarded millions of dollars in loans to six real estate investment firms to help develop this new area. The zoning map for The Estates calls for two rows of four buildings each, located between the River and Main Street. The meadows on the other side of the River are to remain a recreational area for the City.  But, with hopes of larger profits, investors and building tycoons entirely ignore the City Council's demands and begin developing three rows of buildings instead. The Mayor catches wind of the potential for profit and begins planning a new mansion in The Estates, which would double the value of one of the building rows! With some sketchy Building Permits, investors begin developing buildings on the other side of the River, beyond the designated building zone.  However, the City Council takes rigorous steps to put an end to the racketeering with an ultimatum: as soon as the first two rows are completed, the buildings in the uncompleted row will be torn down, resulting in a huge loss for all who invested there. At the end of the day, the investor with the highest-valued buildings will come out on top!

Between Two Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a competitive tile-drafting game in which each tile is a room in a castle.

The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center. \r\n Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities. Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may only build one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route. \r\n Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card. The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards. On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one. If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it. The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage. Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route. Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn. \r\n When a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered. Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends. Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, and lose points for unplaced post offices. The player with the most points wins. \r\n The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element. ",

For example, if the topic is \"cat\", you could draw an ear or a whisker so that the other players know you know the topic. There is one fake artist among the players - someone who doesn't know the topic and will have to draw a line randomly.  After each player has drawn twice, they will have to decide who the fake artist is. If the fake artist receives the most votes, that player loses. Otherwise, the fake artist and the game master win the game. Now, you might think it is extremely easy to find out who the fake artist is, but there is one more rule: Even if the fake artist receives the most votes, that player can still guess the topic of the picture everyone drew - and win with a correct guess!  Knowing this rule, it becomes much more difficult for the real artists to draw their lines.

Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out. ",

Created by master designer Reiner Knizia,  The Lord of the Rings  is fully illustrated by celebrated Tolkien artist John Howe. Help guide the Fellowship past Sauron's wickedness and save Middle Earth from darkness! Players take on the role of five Hobbits-Merry, Pippen, Fatty, Sam, and Frodo-on their quest to destroy the One Ring.

The Lord of the Rings board game is a unique and original game in which players must work together to defeat the game itself, a daunting task that will challenge even the most experienced players. The cooperative play style immerses players into the game, cheering their success and cursing the foul turns of fate that hinder their quest.  The Silver Line Edition of The Lord of the Rings was given a graphics overhaul, retaining the elegant illustrations of John Howe while updating the game boards and components. Because many of the components have changed in size and design (making the game much more compact)  the Silver Line edition is incompatible with previously released expansions.  ",

First, nearly every route on the game board is a double-route, with two tracks connecting cities. Both of these routes are in play no matter how many players are in the game. \r\n Second, every route — whether double or single — has a bridge toll that a player must pay when building on that route. On a single route or the first track of a double route, the player pays this toll — which costs 1-4 coins — to the bank; on the second track of a double route, the player pays this toll to the player who built the first track. Players start the game with 30 coins, and if you can't pay a toll, you must take a loan card to cover the fare, with each loan costing you 5 points at the end of the game. \r\n In addition to helping you avoid loans, coins matter because at game's end, players receive a bonus based on how many coins they hold relative to everyone else. In a five-player game, for example, the player with the most coins scores a 55 point bonus; the 2nd place player scores 35 points, and the other players 20, 10 and 0 points. If you've taken a loan, however, you're ineligible for this bonus scoring, so players have an incentive to build early and often. \r\n These coin bonuses are balanced by the multitude of destination tickets with large point values: six of them are worth 29+ points while another seventeen are worth 17-26 points. \r\n \r\n\r\n ",

While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a uniquely cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.  Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of resources to use, resulting in an output of more resources, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, VP and all kinds of resources.   Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for resources, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Convocation follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.  The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.  The game is almost all simultaneous play, keeping the game play moving. \r\n  Contents:  \r\n \r\n 390 Cards \r\n 292 Wood pieces \r\n Dozens of tokens \r\n 9 Player sheets detailing tips and advice on how to play a race \r\n Rulebook \r\n ",

They thereby won expertise in navigation and shipbuilding, heralding the Age of Exploration and enabling Portugal to later to find a sea trade route to India and China. In the height of its power Portugal controlled the sea trade from Brazil to Japan and attained overwhelming wealth with the trade monopoly on spices.  The players represent wealthy trade dynasties that help to build up the Portuguese colonial empire. Tracing the routes of famous explorers they advance all the way to Nagasaki--but sailing into unknown waters is a dangerous venture. Founding colonies and building factories helps them to build up an economic base. But the prices for sugar, gold and spices fluctuate all the time, and only the trade dynasty that adapts to the market will be able to finance its lofty plans. Competing for new discoveries, colonies, shipyards, and churches it is very important to observe the actions of the other players.  Navigator is a challenging strategy game with a little luck, because no-one knows exactly what to expect when discovering new sea regions. Player's turns follow simple rules and are executed on a rondel, which leads to a fluent play experience. ",

Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector. Bring a basket if you think it's your lucky day. Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza. If you're hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you saute them in butter. Feeling mercantile? Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest. \r\n   Morels  , a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms – sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough – earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn. \r\n Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time. The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead. ",

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination is beyond calculation, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.    Forbidden Stars  challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same - to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You'll need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you. \r\n Each round in  Forbidden Stars  is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to: \r\n \r\n  Dominate , draining friendly planets of their important resources \r\n  Strategize , purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities \r\n  Deploy , building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units \r\n  Advance , moving units and attacking their enemies. \r\n \r\n The last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle. \r\n Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in  Forbidden Stars  is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.

Cards come in six colors: red for military, green for resource production, blue for trade, brown for scoring, purple for temples, and yellow for a variety of effects. \r\n When you construct a building, you build it in the appropriate location on the modular game board — which is sized based on the number of players with the hexagonal tiles composed of seven landscape \"circles\" — then you place the card in your personal tableau in the appropriate stack of colored cards and activate the power of all of those cards already in your tableau, starting with the card at the bottom of the stack. \r\n When you make an offering, you discard cards, then receive the help of a god associated with one of the cards that you discarded, with the number of cards determining the strength of the associated action. You then refill your hand to five cards. \r\n The game ends either when all the barbarian villages on the game board have been surrounded and attacked or when all the temples have been constructed. Whoever has the most points wins. \r\n \r\n ",

At the beginning of a journey, all players place their pawns within the aircraft; the players start the game with six cards in hand (or eight depending on the number of players).

We fight for our species' history and its future. We fight for its soul. A.R.K. is aware that there will be countless employees - fools blinded by the corporate veil - who will resist. So be it. There is too much at stake here to protect the purposefully ignorant. We will consider those who side with Raxxon as part of Raxxon itself, and mark our words, Raxxon will burn.  Stealth, the search, the fight, and the thrill of the hunt. Specter Ops: Shadow of Babel puts you and 1-4 friends in the middle of a war for society that's fought in the shadows.   Specter Ops Board and Setup  On one side, a lone A.R.K. agent infiltrates a Raxxon facility, seeking to retrieve three mission targets and escape alive. Equipped with unique skills and tools, the agent moves in secret.  On the other side, two or more genetically enhanced Raxxon hunters, alerted to the intruder's presence, take no prisoners as they attempt to eliminate the A.R.K. agent before a successful escape. Super-human mutations and keen coordination aid them in their duty to destroy Raxxon's enemies.  Each turn, the A.R.K. agent marks their moves secretly, indicating their board location only if they pass through a hunter's line of sight. If the A.R.K. player can collect three out of four mission objectives and escape without losing all their life points, they win. Four agents to choose from as well as 12 equipment cards means a variety of strategies and experiences are possible.  The Raxxon hunters move every turn as well, and drive a vehicle that rushes across the board and detects the motion of the A.R.K. agent. Every time a hunter gets the A.R.K. agent in their line of sight, they have a chance to do damage to the agent. Four hunters, all with different powers, complement the four agents, and all eight characters are represented by high quality miniatures.  Specter Ops: Shadow of Babel features a streamlined ruleset great for veteran and rookie gamers alike. Several game modes accommodate 2-5 players who must utilize strategy, deduction, and stealth to win. Plot your moves in secret or hunt down the intruder. Specter Ops is an exciting stealth game that belongs in every gamer's collection.  Specter Ops: Shadow of Babel is published jointly by Plaid Hat Games and Nazca Games. ",

As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators \"Schwarze Kapelle\", the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late? \r\n   Black Orchestra   begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots). \r\n But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected. \r\n On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions — at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling \"Conspire\" action allows players to make bold moves when most needed. \r\n After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany. \r\n To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator & fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of \"Target\" symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any \"Eagles\" rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved. \r\n Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience. \r\n \r\n\r\n ",

    "description_preview": "   Glen More II: Chronicles   is a sequel to  Glen More , expanding the gameplay substantially compared to the original game. \r\n In  Glen More II: Chronicles , each player represents the leader of a Scottish clan from the early medieval ages until the 19th century, a leader looking to expand their territory and wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles. \r\n The game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play. \r\n The core mechanism of  Glen More II: Chronicles  and  Glen More  functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn. \r\n Improvements over the original  Glen More  include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to  Glen More . \r\n The \"Chronicles\" in the title — a set of eight expansions to the base game — are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The \"Highland Boat Race\" Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The \"Hammer of the Scots\" Chronicle adds a neutral \"Englishman\" playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn — if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a \"monster game\". \r\n Another major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new \"person\" tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board. \r\n  —description from the publisher  ",

As the chief of your tribe, you must lead your people to prosperity through the cultivation and trade of cacao — and to do that, you'll need to put them to work in the best way possible. \r\n In the game, each player has an individual deck of square worker tiles, with the number of workers on each side of the tile varying from tile to tile. The playing area starts with only a couple of jungle tiles in play: a cacao field and a small market; two jungle tiles are laid face up, and the remaining jungle tiles stacked as a draw pile. \r\n On a player's turn, he places one of her worker tiles on the board adjacent to one or more jungle tiles already in play, then (if two worker tiles are next to an empty space) adds one of the jungle tiles to the playing area in this space. Her workers then get busy and deliver the results of their effort: If you placed workers next to a cacao field, you receive one or two cacao markers per worker; if they're next to a market, you can choose to sell one cacao marker per worker at the listed price; if next to a well, you receive water; if next to a temple, they stand and look good until the end of the game; and so on. He then refills her hand from her personal deck to three worker tiles. \r\n Once all players have used all of their worker tiles, the game ends. Players score (or lose) points based on their water supply, and each temple rewards whichever players sent the most workers to it.

    "description_preview": " Winner of the 2008 International Gamer Awards best two-player strategy game and nominated for numerous other awards, 1960: Making of the President is widely recognized as the best U.S. presidential election game ever published. Of course, the inspiration for this design derives from GMT's blockbuster card-driven game,  Twilight Struggle . So we are pleased to announce that 1960 is coming home to GMT in an all-new edition, just in time for you to argue with your uncle over the 2016 presidential elections.   For those of you unfamiliar, in 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of Kennedy or Nixon vying for the right to lead the United States during the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; the year 1960 is synonymous with great social upheaval and progress. The candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.  The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960-a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon's lazy shave, President Eisenhower's late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state's electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.  The GMT edition of 1960: Making of the President will benefit from the years of suggestions, variants and clarifications that have emerged from game play since the game was first published. However, this will fundamentally be the same great game that players already know and love. ",

One hand holds a compass, the other a machete as you hack your way through the thick underbrush toward what you believe to be your final destination. The remaining members of your expedition follow behind you, watching out for any dangers lurking in the jungle around you. All of a sudden, you hear the cry of a jaguar as it leaps from seemingly nowhere onto the path behind you. A fellow explorer pulls out their gun to defend themselves, but realizes they're out of bullets too late. The jaguar is upon them and they are defenseless. Another companion pulls out their pistol and fires a single shot into the jaguar's skull, but their comrade is already gone. The jungle has met their expedition with loss after loss, but they must keep moving forward. If they can find El Dorado, it will all be worth it in the end.\" Experience the thrill and danger of the lost expedition of Percy Fawcett to find the city of El Dorado. Manage a party of explorers with their own expertise as you make your way through the Brazilian jungle in search of the fabled city of El Dorado in  The Lost Expedtion !   Welcome to the Jungle  In  The Lost Expedition  the goal is to make your way through the jungle and find the city of El Dorado before succumbing to the many dangers. Each expedition begins with three explorers, each with their own health and field of expertise, as well as a shared pool of resources for the journey. Rounds consist of a morning and evening phase in which cards are played in a path the expedition will follow as they make their way through the jungle. Each card has its own effects that range from costing you resources, demanding clever use of your explorers' expertise, or bringing harm to a member of your party. The threat of death lurks around every tree, and the game is lost if all the members of your exploring party are dead. So, do you have the knowhow and strength to make it to El Dorado alive?   Three Ways to Play   The Lost Expedtion  can be played in three different ways! You and several friends can take on the challenges of the Brazilian jungle together, you can go head to head in competition with one other player, or you can forgo another player entirely and challenge yourself to a solo game. You're sure to have fun whichever way you decide to play!   Co-Op   In a Co-Op game, you and up to four other players can work together to find El Dorado. Each player will add cards to the path during the morning and evening phases. Each round will be lead by one of the players who will make final decisions regarding the fate of the explorers, and that mantle will pass at the beginning of a new round of play. Collaborate with the other players to reach the end of the game alive!   Solo   The Lost Expedition  can also be played as a solitaire experience. You will alternate playing cards from the top of the deck and playing cards from your hand as you try to reach El Dorado before your expedition party is killed. Challenge yourself and see if you have what it takes to go it alone!   Head to Head   Finally, face off against another player with the Head-to-Head rules. It's a race to El Dorado or a fight to be the last alive as you form two paths with the other player and take turns picking which path you wish to follow. The first person to reach the city or the last one alive is the winner! Note: In the 'head-to-head' rules, the diagram shows more cards than can legally be played.

The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice -- just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope -- if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.   In the  Gloom  card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.   Printed on transparent plastic cards,  Gloom  features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!   For 2 to 4 players, ages 8 and up.   ",

Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include: \r\n \r\n The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (\"nice\" or \"mean\") to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment. \r\n Two independent player-influenced game timers — the factory production cycle and work week clock — provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions. \r\n A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing. \r\n A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game. \r\n Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently. \r\n \r\n If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time.  Kanban: Automotive Revolution  is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (“One! One! One!”, or “Three! Three! Three!”) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring “Corner on Wheat!” or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points. \r\n The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10. \r\n Pit’s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt’s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit. In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903. Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull. Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904. ",

Accusations are made, fingers are pointed, and after a heated argument, you decide to go your separate ways. \r\n Chaos ensues as the SWAT team is called in and start to close off the city’s exits.

Bribing the Police would be a good idea too, but it isn't cheap. Disguises may help, but they don’t fool everyone. Setting the Police on the trail of your former colleagues will give you a better chance of escape, but the other thieves are thinking the same thing... \r\n  Will you escape the city with the most money, or will the Police lockdown the city before you can escape? \r\n\r\n In Escape Plan, players are the thieves, but they may influence the cops' moves every turn. The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves. The cops are trying to thwart their escape plan — by force if necessary. The players play cards to aid their escape and slow the other players down.

    "description_preview": "  A Few Acres of Snow  covers the long struggle between Britain and France for control of what eventually became Canada.   The game involves a deck-building mechanism which may be familiar to those people who have played another certain award winning card game. Each player starts with a small set of cards. Cards come in two general types, location cards and empire cards. You can add an empire card to your discard pile simply by taking one as an action. Adding a location card is a little more involved. Each location card has a list of locations that it connects to and the transport type required to move to each of those locations. To take control of a neutral location you would have to play a location card with that neutral location on it, then a card that has the correct transport symbol, and then possibly a card with a settler symbol on it if required. You then place a cube in the location and add the location card to your discard pile.  Players take it in turns to perform two actions. There are a range of actions available, such as settling new locations, besieging locations, trading fur, launching Indian raids, and building fortifications. There are also cards that allow you to perform actions to manage your deck, such as getting rid of useless cards and drawing additional cards from your pile. You can also place cards in reserve so that you can use them at a later point in time.  The game ends if a player manages to capture his opponent’s capital city or he has managed to place all of his village or town pieces on the board. In the latter case points are calculated to see who wins.  The game can last from between 30 minutes to two hours, depending on how well players pursue the victory conditions. ",

You know the dangers of K2 all too well. Extreme weather with frequent and deadly storms, exposed, steep, tricky routes and lack of oxygen await you on your way to the summit. You will test your climbing skills to death, try to outsmart the ever-changing weather and always worry about the acclimatization of your 2 mountaineers. Also there are the other teams ready to take the glory for themselves. K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team. You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers. K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike. The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter). ",

As the captain of one of the Emperor's mighty Red Seal ships, you will navigate the seas by placing Tsuro wake tiles to direct your vessel. Take great caution to avoid your opponents' ships ... and those mysteries lurking on the horizon and under the sea. Guide your ship with a steady hand and be the last captain sailing to survive the mystic seas and win! \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n The basic game play of   Tsuro of the Seas   resembles that of Tom McMurchie's  Tsuro : Players each have a ship that they want to sail — that is, keep on the game board — as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game. \r\n Each turn players add \"wake\" tiles to the 7×7 game board; each tile has two \"wake connections\" on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game. \r\n What's new in  Tsuro of the Seas  are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board. \r\n If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water... \r\n \r\n\r\n ",

Can you expand your faction into the most successful galactic empire?    Ambition   is the first expansion to  Roll for the Galaxy . It adds new factions, home worlds, and game tiles, two new dice types, and optional objectives to the base game. Newer players should play without objectives for their first few games. \r\n Set up: \r\n The game adds fourteen double-sided faction tiles and seven home world tiles. These tiles are added to the set from the original game. One of the player’s Home (white) dice in the cup is replaced with a Leader (black) die. The rules suggest that when players are familiar with the expansion then they should add Objectives tiles. The tiles are shuffled and six are put into play. \r\n Game play: \r\n When a Leader die has been rolled with two phase symbols showing, then if the die’s assigned phase is not put into play then the die automatically shifts to the other phase on that face. When the Leader die show a dollar sign on its face then if the die is used for its intended phase then the die goes back into the cup (not into the Citizenry) after use. When a Leader die is used as a Consume action, it always matches the world’s color. \r\n The game adds Entrepreneur (orange) dice. When used as a Consume action, Entrepreneur dice never match the world’s color. \r\n When an Objective tile has been satisfied, the player who met the objective receives the number Talent Counters stated. A player may assign Talent Counters as workers during the Assign phase. Used Talent Counters are put back into the pool. Unused Talent Counters are worth a victory point. ",

    "description_preview": " \r\n  Fight in the Famous Battle of Sekigahara!  Two factions vie for power in vacuum left behind by the death of Toyotomi Hideyori. Spurred on by the establishment of a new centralized military power, daimyos throughout Japan pledge their loyalty and make tentative alliances in a 7-week conflict which would decide the fate and ruler of all Japan. But the conflict arises more suddenly than anyone could anticipate. Loyalties will be tested, strategies developed on the fly, and battles decided by the cunning and courage of their commanders. Assume the role of Tokugawa Ieyasu or Ishida Mitsunari in the battle that turned the tides and led to the founding of the Tokugawa Shogunate. This is  Sekigahara !    Muster the Troops and Plan your Strategy!   Sekigahara  is a beginner-friendly wargame played over a series of 7 rounds, 1 for each week of the historic contest. The game begins with players setting up their armies and drawing their hand of cards from their faction's deck. Some designated troops are assigned to important locations on the map, but each game will have players assign some number of troops randomly. Troops are deployed so that players can only see the type and number of their own troops. This element of random deployment and secrecy creates an air of tension between the players. With troops assigned, players can begin planning their strategy and implementing their campaign to take control of Japan. Move your armies along the highways and take control of important locations to gain resources and reinforcements that will help you to win your battles.   Martial Contests of Loyalty and Honor!  Battles will decide the fate of the two armies, and loyalties will be tested as players overrun their enemies with superior forces, test the loyalties of each other's retainers, and rally to siege castles and take out the opposing commander.   Muster the Troops   Players will move their armies across the board to take key locations and bolster their forces in the battles to come. They are given the option to muster new forces to assist them in future battles, hoping to turn the tides in their favor if it's in the cards.   Engage in Battle   Take turns passing initiative and playing cards to deploy troops into battle. A players hand of cards is a precious resource that will help them better plan their movements and prepare for battle. Play a card with a symbol which matches your troop to deploy it into battle. Some cards even enable certain troops to engage special attacks, increasing their impact on the battle. Whichever player generates more impact will win the battle and force their foe to take losses and retreat. But things are not as simple as they seem.   Challenge Loyalty   Troops are hidden from your opponent until they are deployed, so it is impossible to know how a battle will resolve. It all comes down to the troops involved and the loyalty cards the players hold. Some cards will allow a player to challenge the loyalty of an opposing troop. If the challenge succeeds, the troop will swap sides and fight for you until the end of the battle. Treachery and loyalty defined the conflict at  Sekigahara , and your battles will be the same. \r\n COMPONENTS: Mounted Map 119 wooden pieces 1 and 1/2 sticker sheets 110 cards Rulebook Two player aid cards \r\n ",

Thus, the BLACK ANGEL project is launched. The Black Angel, the first intergalactic frigate in history, must transport the genetic heritage of humanity beyond known worlds, over a journey that is likely to last several thousand years.

The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. \"Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala\", murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. \"The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own\". Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight... \r\n \r\nThe Great Zimbabwe is a game about building a trade based civilization in ancient Africa. It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork. \r\n \r\nIn the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.",

The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors.  Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:  -Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc. -Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them. -Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster. -Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.  After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food!  You score points for eating meeples, collecting floors and teeth,  and for achieving the goal on your character card.

Discworld Ankh-Morpork blends the distinctive humor of Terry Pratchett’s best-selling novels with strategic challenge and a dose of mayhem into one devilishly addictive Discworld adventure for two to four players. Suitable for all the family, you don’t have to be a Discworld fan to play this game, but you might end up as one. Discworld Ankh-Morpork was devised by internationally renowned games designer Martin Wallace and a dedicated team of artists overseen by the Discworld Emporium. ",

In Freedom: The Underground Railroad, first available as a print-and-play game titled Conductor, players are working to build up the strength of the Abolitionist movement through the use of notable figures and pivotal events. By raising support for the cause and moving slaves to freedom in Canada, the minds of Americans can be changed and the institution of slavery can be brought down.   Freedom: The Underground Railroad is a card-driven, cooperative game for two to four players in which the group is working for the abolitionist movement to help bring an end to slavery in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game.  Players need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause.  The goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations.  Through careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time. ",

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent’s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings. \r\n The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings – or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards. \r\n  Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends  offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc. \r\n In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score. \r\n The rules of  Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends  are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits. \r\n \r\n ",

There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA.\" \r\n \"LUNA\" is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor. The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves.

The command playing cards supply those orders, providing an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities. You must maximize your opportunities by playing your command cards judiciously. How well you handle the diverse units, their weapons, and the terrain, will determine victory.  Commands & Colors: Ancients contains the battles of Akragas, Crimissos River, Ticinus River, Lake Trasimenus, Cannae, Dertosa, Castulo, Baecula, Ilipa, and Zama. ",

Over 90% of the world's population was eliminated, driving the survivors to band together into loose communities and tribes. Each player is the leader of a small tribe of survivors. Resources, tools, medicine, and mercenaries are all in scarce supply. Each tribe is pitted against other tribes in a fight for survival.   The players build up their tribes, skirmish against other players' tribes, and can even bluff on the way to victory.  The leader who gathers the largest tribe will win the game!    HQ expansion: The first expansion for Arctic Scavengers introduces the notion of a base camp or headquarters for each tribe. This base camp consists of a Tribal Leader (complete with special abilities) and the potential to construct buildings that can be used strategically during game play. Additionally, the game introduces alternative victory paths, new mercenaries, new tools, and the addition of the \"engineering schematics\" pile.    Recon expansion: The world of Arctic Scavengers pits players against one another in an attempt to survive a post-apocalyptic ice age. As the competing tribes developed and grew, headquarters were established for each tribe (supported via the HQ expansion that shipped with the first release). As the tribes evolved further and struggled for dominance, information has become the most valuable currency. In this new world, deception reigns, leading to a need for reconnaissance. ",

You've heard of far-off places - exotic countries, where they have pancakes but not waffles, where the people wear the wrong number of shirts, and don't even have a word for the look two people give each other when they each hope that the other will do something that they both want done but which neither of them wants to do. It is to these lands that you now turn your gaze.   This is the 6th addition to the game of Dominion. It adds 26 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, including 20 Actions, 3 Treasures, 3 Victory cards, and 3 Reactions. The central theme is cards that do something immediately when you buy them or gain them.  Dominion: Hinterlands is an expansion, and cannot be played by itself; to play with it, you need Dominion, or a standalone expansion to Dominion (e.g., Dominion: Intrigue). Those provide the Basic cards you need to play (Treasure, Victory, and Curse cards), as well as the full rules for setup and gameplay. Dominion: Hinterlands can also be combined with any other Dominion expansions you have. ",

A player can spend her turn to add two tickets from her hand to the cardholder. A team's points are tracked collectively, and the team with the highest score wins. \r\n •  Legendary Asia  from François Valentyne – The main change in this set-up is that some of the routes through Asia are labeled mountain routes, with one or more spaces on the route bearing an X.

Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Raul, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans' deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar. Castro's takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.  Following up on GMT Games' Andean Abyss, the COIN Series next volume,  Cuba Libre , takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution. Castro's Marxist \"26 July Movement\" must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana. Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and ex-patriots try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro. Batista's Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors: its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim. And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.   Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players-both volumes share the same innovative COIN system. Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4-and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss. But Cuba Libre's situation and strategic challenges will be new. A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life. ",

Instead of figuring out which cards you might be allowed to play, you choose which card you want to play. Epic is non-collectable, so every box contains the same 120 unique event and champion cards, with 8 double-sided cards to represent temporary \"token\" champions. One box supports reconstructed, sealed and draft formats for 2-4 players, two boxes up to 8 players, and three if you want to create a full constructed deck or a \"cube\" environment for drafting. ",

Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment.

If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Energy Nodes, and you use this energy to either activate Ship Foundries to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit Towers to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into Solar Gates which span the high energy membranes separating one layer of the sun from the next.

Number one goes to the player whose letter comes first in the clue, number two to the second letter etc. They can always use a wild card which can be any letter, but they cannot tell others which letter it represents. \r\n Each player with a numbered token (or tokens) in front of them then tries to figure out what their letter is. If they do, they place the card face down before revealing the next letter. At the end of the game, players can then rearrange the cards to try to form an existing word.

An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayors grip on the city is tenuous at best.

    "name": "Talisman (Revised 4th Edition)",
    "description_preview": " Theme: \r\n Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world. Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc. The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command. Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top. \r\n Goal: \r\n Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions. They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other. Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command. Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell. \r\n Gameplay: \r\n To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided. Characters have basic statistics to start. These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence]. Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two. Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells. This all makes the players actually feel different during play. In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc. \r\n Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices. On a player's turn they throw a die for movement. Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world. Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space. Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter. These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics. Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions. If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so. The defender defends with same statistic attacked with. If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice. If the attacker loses, he loses a life. \r\n Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world. There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price. Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple. However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card. \r\n In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman. The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World. \r\n Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World. There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command. Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life. It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off. ",

Even Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, offering his services to the Empire and feeding his prisoners to the Sarlaac.  Altogether, Rise of the Empire introduces eight new leaders, thirty-six plastic miniatures, five target markers, two attachment rings, three new dice, and more than one-hundred new cards. You'll find U-wings, TIE Strikers, Nebulon-B frigates, and the Interdictor. You'll gain new ways of subverting your opponent's plans, and you'll discover a whole new chapter in your ongoing Galactic Civil War! ",

    "description_preview": " What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard? \r\n   Mage Wars   — redubbed  Mage Wars Arena  in 2015 to distinguish it from  Mage Wars Academy  — pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts – all of this and more await you in the arena of  Mage Wars ! \r\n  Mage Wars  is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called \"zones\", which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy. \r\n Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells – such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments – are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures. \r\n Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies: \r\n \r\n The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments. \r\n The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures. \r\n The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates. \r\n The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end. \r\n \r\n The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc. \r\n Mage Wars Arena Contents: \r\n -2 New Spellbook designs  -New Arena Board design  -Alternate Art for Bear Strength, Dispel, Dissolve, Minor Heal and Rhino Hide  -New Artwork for Battle Fury, Force Push, Hand of Bim Shalla, Teleport, and Temple of Light  -Plus, 14 additional spell cards have been added to make spellbook building easier, including Dispel, Dissolve, Force Push and others ",

One player offers a card to another player stating what creature is pictured on it - correctly or incorrectly. The player who misjudges the other ends up with the card. \"This is a stink bug!” You can peek at the card and pass it on: \"Oh no, it‘s a spider!” True or false - who knows? Are you a good bluffer? \r\n \r\n \r\n As in its parent game  Kakerlakenpoker ,   Kakerlakenpoker Royal   has nothing to do with poker – except that the game is all about bluffing, but with cards showing cockroaches, rats and stink bugs instead of queens, 10s and aces. To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players. On a turn, a player takes one card from his hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of his choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., \"Stink bug\". The player receiving the card either: \r\n \r\n  Accepts the card , says either \"true\" or \"false\", then reveals the card. If this player is wrong in her claim, she keeps the card on the table in front of her face up; if she is right, the player who gave her the card places it face up before him. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Passes the card to another player , peeking at it first, then keeping it face-down and either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must accept it and make a true/false claim. \r\n \r\n The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins. \r\n To this,  Kakerlakenpoker Royal  adds new rules and new nasty \"royal\" critters to create more options for players during the game. \r\n \r\n ",

The best of you will receive the gratitude of the region's people forever and a statue in their town square to show their deepest appreciation. \r\n A game of   Via Nebula   starts with a board showing a hexagonal grid, some production sites with a few available resources on them (wood, stone, wheat, and pigs), building sites in various areas scattered over the whole board, and a lot of mist. \r\n Turn after turn, players have two actions at their disposal from these options: They may clear the mist of a hex to create new paths of transportation, open new production sites, open a building site in a city, carry resources from any production site to their own building sites, and, of course, achieve a construction. Resources and paths through the mist may be used by all the players. This initially induces a kind of cooperation, but eventually other players will take advantage of your actions! \r\n To achieve a construction, you fulfill a contract on one of your cards. You start the game with two contracts, and four more contracts are available for all players to see and use on a first come, first served basis — and that's where the cooperation abruptly stops. Additionally, most contracts have special powers that are triggered on completion. \r\n The game ends when a player finishes a fifth building. Opponents each take two final actions, then players score based on the number of cleared hexes and opened production sites and the point value of their contracts, with a bonus for the player who ended the game.

Now, the barbaric kingdoms that lie beyond the galactic frontier are amassing their strength, choosing this pivotal moment to strike at the heart of the fading republic, establishing new empires built upon the ashes of decaying civilizations.  But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces. Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves.   Core Worlds is a deck-building card game for 2-5 players. Each player controls a barbarian Star Empire represented by many cards. Throughout the game, players will invade Worlds and draft new Units and Tactics into their Empires. Each card lists its Empire Points in the upper right corner. The player whose Empire contains the most Empire Points at the end of the game is the winner! ",

There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card ''Orders'' conducted by the active player. Fate Card ''Actions'' may generally be conducted by either player at any time. ''Events'' - both good and bad - will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player's perfect plan.",

Each turn goes as follows: \r\n\r\n 1. Action Phase: Perform three actions, such as play new cards, get new cards from the market, speculate on cards in the market, buy land, or redeploy troops. \r\n2. Discard Headlines: Remove any Headlines (i.e. cards with the Bull-Bear icon) that have reached the leftmost position in the Market. \r\n3. Restore Market: Restore the Market to twelve cards. \r\n4. Income Phase: Collect one gold per Income, Extortion, and Connection Cube in play. If Depression, pay one gold for each card in play (includes Partners and Enterprises in your Row, and all of your Troops). \r\n\r\n Four \"scoring\" cards (Toppling) are in the game and their effect depends on the current form of government. The government can change if troops are played and as a result of other cards. The form of government also influences different production values of the game, such as how much mines produce. Players win by toppling Díaz, either by coup, succession, revolution, or annexation of Mexico by the U.S. If Díaz remains firmly seated at the end of the game, then the player with the most gold wins. \r\n\r\n  Pax Porfiriana  includes 220 cards, but only fifty cards (along with ten for each player) are used in a game, so no two games will be the same!  The Collector's Edition comes in a much bigger box, with additional pieces, mapboard, rules, and player aids.  ",

    "description_preview": "  Onirim  is a solo/cooperative card game in which you navigate the landscape of dreams themselves. By playing or discarding Location cards, you search for oneiric doors that will lead you from the dream labyrinth. Playing three Location cards of the same color in a row reveals a door. You can use the power of Prophecy to re-order the top five cards of the deck. But make haste! Time is short, and you are not alone in the labyrinth. Terrifying nightmares slither through its corridors to thwart your quest by any means possible. Encountering one triggers a penalty, such as forcing you to discard your hand of cards. If you get all eight Door cards into play before the deck runs out, you escape the labyrinth and win the game! \r\n This edition of Onirim contains seven expansions that can alter your journey through the labyrinth in new and mysterious ways. Each expansion adds new cards that create new challenges and grants you additional control over the dream world. All expansions can be added to base game individually or mixed in any number of combinations with one another. \r\n \r\n \"The Towers\" introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition. \r\n \"Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions\" adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies. \r\n \"The Book of Steps Lost and Found\", challenges you to find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task. \r\n \"The Glyphs\" introduces a fourth symbol on location cards (apart from Key, Sun and Moon), which makes it easier to compose the row of unrepeated symbols. However, you must then find one extra door of each color to win. \r\n \"The Dreamcatchers\" are four cards that \"guard\" the Limbo piles. The Limbo pile stays with Dreamcatcher until some effect allows the player to shuffle the pile back to the deck... if all Dreamcatchers are full and new cards should come to Limbo, a Dreamcatcher is discarded and their cards get shuffled back. Also, four new \"Lost Dreams\" cards are supposed to be in Limbo at the end of the game, as an extra winning condition - so discarding all Dreamcatchers means loss. \r\n \"The Crossroads and Dead Ends\" introduce location cards with a given symbol (3 Sun, 2 Moon, 1 Key), but serving as any color \"joker\". It also contains 10 \"Dead End\" cards, that remain in players hand (un-discard-able on its own) and block your 5-cards hand limit... until a player discards the whole hand (=the only way to discard a Dead End). \r\n \"The Door To The Oniverse\" brings several one-time abilities cards as \"inhabitants of the Oniverse\"... and one extra colorless door to find. \r\n ",

With muscle and magic, you'll unearth riches, dig out collapsed tunnels, and carve out great halls as you raise the toppled statues of your ancestors to their places of honor at the heart of the mountain. Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system. Timing and tactics are key as you work to restore your home to its former glory and win the crown! \r\n Working on the same game board with the other players (but beginning at your own entrance), you'll dig a competing network of tunnels by spending increasingly valuable materials to lay polyomino tiles onto the map. You want to extend your tunnels to connect with buried gold and materials, with workshop locations that can transform resources, and especially with toppled statues. Statues are key to scoring, and you'll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain. \r\n A major aspect of the game is the cascading production. You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources — gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers — that it produces. When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a \"pyramid\". The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry. In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears. The timing of your hiring turns versus your building turns is important as you try to maximize your cascades while making sure you get the trolls you want from the shared market and also stay competitive on the map. \r\n The game ends shortly after the last player hires their sixth troll, then the player with the most honor (earned for digging tunnels of increasing quality, for excavating great halls, and for moving statues closer to the heart of the mountain, especially onto matching pedestals) is crowned the Mountain King and wins!

Richard Arkwright was one of the English inventors and businessmen who developed the first advanced machines (e.g. the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame) and founded early factories. The goods produced in this manner were highly regarded in both the old country and by the Englishmen living in the colonies.  In Arkwright, 2 to 4 players lead enterprises and try to develop and run them profitably over several decades. It is important to invest in your own company and ensure that the value of its shares rises. The player with the most valuable portfolio of their shares wins the game.   In the beginning, workers are required to run the factories. However, their expensive wages make machines very desirable. To increase a factory's production of goods, you may hire more workers or improve the technological level of your factory.  You determine the price of your goods for each of your factories. To enhance the chances of selling your goods to serve the demand in England, you can improve the technological level of your factories, increase the quality of your goods, and partake in distribution activities. The higher these factors are, the more successful you will be. However, the higher your prices, the less appealing your goods become. ",

One Deck Dungeon is a tabletop version of the popular video game phenomenon of roguelikes -- dungeon delves where you try and survive as long as you can against increasingly nasty monsters. The game is very easy to learn, featuring intuitive dice mechanics and thematic skills and abilities. As a 1-2 player cooperative game, One Deck Dungeon is a great fit for in-store demos, and the artwork and components make for an attractive demo display. With the base game plus the expansion, (or two copies of either), a group can bring a party of four into the dungeon). An important part of our art and presentation strategy for One Deck Dungeon was that all five of its heroes were women, and realistically-clad.

The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there’s very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause. \r\n The game is played on the map of the submarine. The conditions in the submarine are represented by three disaster tracks: Asphyxiation, Heat and Pressure. During the game, these conditions get worse, and if anyone of them reaches its maximum value, the submarine is lost. In addition, various emergencies can occur which have to be dealt with swiftly, or they'll also lead to the loss of the submarine. \r\n Each turn, a player can move to a new location, and perform some action there. Such an action can be repairs (which will improve conditions on the sub and/or fix emergencies), removing obstacles (unblocking hatches, removing flooding or extinguishing fires) or stocking up on equipment (which will help with later actions). Each action is paid for with time. The more time a player spends on an action, the greater the chance of success. After each player's turn, a number of events will happen; the more time was spent, the more events will occur. Such events will be the worsening of conditions in the submarine, or the triggering of emergencies. \r\n If the Gnomes can keep alive long enough, rescue will arrive and the game is won. \r\n \r\n\r\n ",

There are three eras - rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 - with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:  * Buy new cards from the common display * Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options) * Train/Educate your people * Build/found cities * Take money ",

It is important to control the contents of your bag utilizing flavor effects and unique effects caused by placing tokens on the roast board. \r\n There are 22 varieties of beans in the game.

No less than nine horrific beasts stand in your way - that, and the greed of the other players.  In this game of kill-stealing, you decide whether to swing for a whopping 50 points of damage - or hold back, awaiting a more opportune time to strike. Only the final blow matters if you are to score the kill. Hold back or sabotage other's plans too much - and the entire party will die, without a winner.  Okay, that's what it says on the box... what's it really like?   Cutthroat Caverns  is truly unique. While most definitely a highly interactive card game and very easy to play, it requires the strategic thinking of a board game. And, for some uncanny reason, the game will make you FEEL like you are in the middle of a classic dungeon crawl, even though table talk is about as much roleplaying as you are likely to do. That all said, it has proven to have a very broad appeal with gamers across several genres.   The real joy is the delicate balance between helping the party (and staying alive) vs working towards your own selfish goals (and risking the welfare of everyone). There are no dice. Each Turn, you will choose how much damage you are willing to do to the monster- or won't do - as you jockey for position to land the killing blow. And when characters can make that kind of decision, things get very funny & very deadly - very quickly.  With 25 encounters, all requiring a different group strategy and seperate individual strategy, game play is always challenging. Only 9 random encounters will be used in any game, so the experience is always different. Plus, the first expansion is already complete with 15 new, tougher encounters and a whole new 'character enhancing' game mechanic to keep people coming back. ",

On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do? Up to you to decide!

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies. \r\n  Detective: CoA  uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O'Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy's Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they're wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve. \r\n  Detective: CoA  includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and \"hot\" leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience. \r\n Inspired by classic film noir like  The Big Sleep , the works of James Ellroy ( L.A. Confidential ), and the video game  L.A. Noire  from Rockstar Games,  Detective: City of Angels  is a murder-mystery game unlike any other. Will one detective rise above the rest and close the case on L.A.'s latest high profile murder? Or will The Chisel sow enough doubt and confusion to prevent the detectives from solving the crime? ",

Schemes and Reactions are represented by cards in the Intrigue Deck. Players wield their Influence to put their Schemes into play, often asking for (or bribing) another player’s help in hatching the most complex plots. \r\n The Market Phase is when players buy, sell and trade Assets (Gladiators, Slaves, Equipment and Guards). Players also bid against each other to acquire new Assets at Auction. Wealth is not the only path to success as players bluff and bargain with each other to acquire the Assets they covet. \r\n The Arena Phase is when the bloody games are held. Gladiators from two rival Houses are pitted against each other in a brutal fight for glory. The spectacles of the games are represented by miniature combat on the arena board. Fighters pit their Attack, Defense and Speed dice against one another to determine the victor. All players seek to increase their fortunes by betting on the outcome of the gruesome conflict. Fighters who emerge from the arena victorious gain Favor and their Dominus gain Influence. \r\n The goal of the game is to become the most influential house in Capua, securing your family’s power for years to come.

In the beginning, each caravan consists of three cards that are spread out vertically so that the top part of each card is visible; each card stands for a caravan member with different abilities. On his turn, a player performs only one action, choosing one of the cards on top of the three caravans and executing one action shown on that card. Then the card is put at the back of its caravan. To use the same caravan member again, a player must first use all the other cards on top of that caravan row. The core mechanism of Kashgar could be called \"open deck-building\". The game plays quickly with little downtime. Simple, yet so much fun and lots of strategies to explore.",

How to play:  At the start of each round, each player places their character on the level tile, then draws one treasure and places it above their character board. Once everyone does this, draw the topmost level card to see whether players suffer damage from the monster on it. Players can then decide whether to leave the round and bank their treasures, or whether to press on; if they go on, they draw another treasure card, then reveal the next level card. If you take total damage equal to your number of hearts, you fail and are out of the round, losing any treasure that you had. \r\n Once everyone has left the round, whether by being knocked out or by passing and banking their treasures, players can buy building cards, such as bowling alleys, arcades, and soap makers. Buildings cost 1-5 treasures, and you must pay different treasures when buying a building that costs more than 1. Each building gives a one-time or permanent effect. Maybe you'll collect jump tokens that you can use to clear monsters so that you don't take damage; maybe you'll acquire a hospital that gives you coins when neighboring players fail the level; maybe you'll buy more hearts to let you run farther in the future; and maybe you'll collect coins, which can be the most precious item of all since the game ends after the round that someone collects 20 coins. Whoever has the most coins at that time wins!   Megaland contains six starred building types that are used in each game, along with seventeen other building types, with only seven of them being used in any game.  ",

Foremost of these great achievements in the city is the massive Porta Nigra, a large Roman city gate located in Trier, Germany that dates to the 2nd century. \r\n \r\nThe game Porta Nigra (which translates as \"black gate\") is set in that place and time with the players taking on the roles of Roman architects working on the city gate of Porta Nigra. Each player commands a master builder, who moves around a circular track on the game board, enabling you to buy or build only where this master builder is located. Moving the master builder to farther locations along the track is expensive, so players must plan their movements and builds carefully. The number and type of actions that may be performed on your turn comes from cards in your personal draw deck. \r\n \r\nThe buildings in Porta Nigra are erected physically on the game board at the various locations in the city.  This is accomplished with 3-D plastic building pieces, which gives Porta Nigra a beautiful and compelling look on the table. \r\n \r\nPorta Nigra is in the new Stronghold Games' The Great Designers Series - #1, which will be an ongoing series of games featuring the greatest game designers from around the world.

Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire. \r\n Use iconic characters to engage in military battles, struggles for power, and the intrigues of court. \r\n A crucial part of winning the game of thrones is plotting your next move. In A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, each player has a plot deck consisting of seven carefully chosen cards. At the beginning of each round, every player looks through his available plot cards and selects one plot to use that round. \r\n Plot cards provide the gold you use to play cards, decide initiative for the round, determine how powerful your attacks are, and provide powerful effects that can last throughout the round. You may launch a devastating wildfire assault and kill multiple characters, or you may plead a noble cause and bring the lords and ladies of your faction into play. By switching the plots that you use in your plot deck, you can make your main deck function very differently and choosing the right plot for the situation is crucial to claiming victory. \r\n Eight unique factions are available for players to enjoy and each boasts a different playstyle. You may even ally two factions together in a single deck to unite their strengths. \r\n The game of thrones is played out on the battlefields of Westeros and in whispered conversations at court, in secret alliances and bold ultimatums. In this LCG, you’ll attack your opponent with three types of challenges: military, intrigue, and power. Each of these challenges has different effects, allowing you to attack your opponents on multiple fronts and punish them in different ways. ",

This is a wargame where the purpose of building your empire is not to feel good about your achievement, but to destroy your enemies and burn their colonies.  One difficulty in games of this genre is that they are often either overly simplistic or tediously detailed. Space Empires has been almost 20 years in the making and, during that time, many elegant solutions have been developed to keep the theme rich without a lot of rules. The game includes carriers and fighters, mines, cloaking, a very large technology tree, fifteen ship classes from scout to dreadnaught, merchant shipping, colonization, mining, terraforming, bases, shipyards, black holes, warp points, and non-player aliens, yet the rules are short and intuitive and the game can be finished on one sitting. This is NOT a game that is hard to get into. The playtest rules are only 6 pages long for the basic game and increase to 10 pages in length when all the advanced rules, optional rules, and scenarios are included.   Exploration is easy (well, easy for you, it is actually dangerous for your ships) and fun and reveals different terrain (such as asteroids and nebulas) which affect your movement and your combat.

Through strategic questioning, each player gathers his bits of information, then skillfully welds them together and formulates the clues which will provide the solution to the mystery. \r\n The Dealer shuffles the Gem Deck and removes one card, placing it where no player may accidentally see it. This becomes the Missing Gem. The remaining Gem cards are dealt evenly to each player to form their hands. Players record the information from their private cards on their information sheets. Any remaining Gem cards are placed face up for all players to note and record on their information sheets.  Each Gem Card has three elements: - Gem (diamond, pearl, or opal), - Color (red, yellow, blue, or green), and - Type (solitaire, pair, or cluster).  Players use Search Cards to discover and record what their opponents hold in their hands-i.e. if a player had the \"Blue Opals\" search card, he could request any other single player show them all the blue opals in their hand. Other search cards have only one characteristic \"element\" of a gem-i.e. just opals, or just blues. With these cards, the interrogated player must reveal only the number of these cards that they hold and not reveal the cards themselves.  Play continues until one player believes they have solved the mystery. They note their guess and check the missing gem. If correct, the player reveals the card and wins the game! If incorrect, the player replaces the missing gem and the game continues. This player is now out of contention but must continue answering any interrogations.

    "description_preview": " Inspired by traditional storytelling, Spirits of the Wild is an exciting, easy to learn, 2-player strategy game of taking powerful stones. Use action cards to help five animals collect their favorite Spirit Stones on your player board and earn valuable points. But beware of Coyote! Your opponent can block your moves by using the crafty Coyote until it can be moved again. Each animal has its own rules for placing the stones; for example, the slow and simple turtle wants only stones of the same color, the quick and nimble rabbit wants three stones in three different colors, and the strict and methodical owl wants stones in like-colored pairs. the Spirit Power cards possess abilities available to both players and can be used to dramatically shift a player's strategy. the player with the most points wins the game, but if there's a tie, the player with Coyote wins. Includes 1 bowl, 1 Coyote pawn, 56 stones in 7 colors, 1 cloth bag, 2 player boards, 12 action cards, and 6 Spirit Power cards. Colors and decorations may vary. ",
